            Barry Allen has featured in several media first appearing in
            animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and

            Barry Allen is a forensic chemist with a reputation for being very
            slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc√©e, Iris West.
          </li>
          <li>
            One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt
            strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals and
            drenches all over Barry, temporarily knocking him out. As a result,
            Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and
            possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing.
          </li>
          <li>
            He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest
            dubs himself the Flash, and becomes Central City's resident costumed
            crime fighter and protector.
          </li>
          <li>
            n the fourth issue of Infinite Crisis, Barry Allen comes out from
            the Speed Force, along with Johnny Quick and Max Mercury, to help
            his grandson Bart deal with Superboy-Prime, taking the villainous
            teen with him in the Speed Force.

            In 2009, writer Geoff Johns and artist Ethan Van Sciver created The
            Flash: Rebirth, a 6-issue miniseries bringing Barry Allen back to a
            leading role in the DC Universe as the Flash, much in the same vein
            as Green Lantern: Rebirth. When asked what Flashes would appear in
            the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, "All of them."

            Barry Allen is one of the main characters in Blackest Night

            After defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first
            time, they've been encountered by the Renegades. The Renegades take
            the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about
            why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon
            has been manipulating everyone as a plot to bring conflict between
            Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force.
